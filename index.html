            <p id="perti">The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, including astronomy, physics,
                philosophy,
                and metaphysics. The following is an overview of different theories related to the cosmos:</p>

                <p id="pori">
                    This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. The Big Bang
                    theory suggests that the history of the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years
                    ago. As a result of the Big Bang, time, space, and all matter were created, leading to the expansion
                    of the cosmos.

                <p id="psami">Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. These are regions where gravity
                    is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape. Black holes interact with nearby matter and
                    can emit radiation.</p>

            <p id="potxi">String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description of the physical world.
                According to this theory, we live in a three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might contain
                additional microscopic, non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined spaces
                with different sizes and characteristics.</p>
